# What is Semantic Code?
In HTML semantics means using a proper element for appropriate content.Semantics gives structure and logical meaning to the code. In simple words, it is the study of the relationship between words and their meanings.

Using semantic tags makes the code typically shorter and downloads faster. Also, semantic code is easier for people to understand, which allows new web designers to read the code and learn faster. 

Many people with visual, audio, and physical impairments rely on features like speech, text, and clearly defined element on websites to effectively navigate and perform tasks on your website. By correctly implementing semantic code into your HTML, browser can interpret your website and provide the necessary features for any impairment.

Also, semantic code tends to improve your placement on search engines, due to the clear layout of the content on your website.

## List of new semantic elements: 
The semantic elements added in HTML5 are:

- `<article>`
- `<aside>` 
- `<details>`
- `<figcaption>`
- `<figure>`-
- `<footer>`
- `<header>`
- `<main>`
- `<mark>`
- `<nav>`
- `<section>`
- `<summary>`
- `<time>`

### Let's discuss the most common and important semantic tags:

**Header :**

The `<header>` elements usually come on top of a page, article, section, or any other division of a page. Generally, the header element may include navigation besides introductory text or heading.

**Nav :**

The purpose of the `<nav>` element is to group all the navigation links. For example menus, table of contents, and indexes.

**The Main Tag :** 

The body of a page goes in the `<main>` tag. All the content coming inside the `<main>` tag should be unique. Sidebars, navigation, links, site logos, copyright information are not included inside the `<main>` tag since thses are repeatative contents. There must not be more than one `<main>` tag in a document.

**Heading :** 

These elements represent headings for particular sections and have a rank given by the number in their name. The `<h1>` element is said to have the highest rank, the `<h6>` element has the lowest rank, and two elements with the same name have equal rank.

**Section :** 

The `<section>` element is use build hierarchy on a page to make it easier for users to identify the group of content. It usually includes a heading. Section  element should not be used as a container for styling purpose. Examples of sections would be chapters, or the numbered sections of a thesis. A Web site's home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, and contact information.

**Article :** 

The `<article>` element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site which can be reused independently in a document. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget, or any other independent item of content.

**Aside :** 

The `<aside>` HTML element is often used for sidebars or for the content that is not part of the flow of the text in which it appears, however still related in some way. It is a block-level element, therefore it will appear on a new line occupying whole available width and hence needs to be positioned as as required using CSS.

**Footer :**

A `<footer>` is generally found at the bottom of a document, a section, or an article. The content related to copyright and author information is usually wraped inside the footer. It also holds contact information, sitemap, and the extra links related to documents.
